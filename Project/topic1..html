      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>Divine identity 

        Here are many great quotes but often when I think a Divine identity, the talk of President Nelson comes to my mind when he stated that we all have labels. We all use labels in our life whether it be for work or for sports. We should not let these labels Define us. We should be defined by the labels that God has given us such as child of God, child of the Covenant, and disciple of Jesus Christ. These other quote support this by testifying that when we truly know this and when we believe in ourselves we are able to remember the great plan and goal that are heavenly father has prepared for us.</p>
