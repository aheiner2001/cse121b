      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>"Let God Prevail" has become a repeatable and memorable phrase in the church. Although this phrase may be relatively new, the idea has been repeatedly taught in the church. There are many things we can do to let God prevail in our lives. The Holy Spirit, being part of the Godhead, should be allowed in our homes to help us feel the love of God. The living prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the one who holds the keys to direct the church. As we follow the prophet, we are letting God prevail in our lives as we listen to and follow his counsel.</p>
