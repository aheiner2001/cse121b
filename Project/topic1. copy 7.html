        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Marriage is ordained of God. Marriage is the relationship that God has ordained between man and women. Marriage is for those that are in love. Marriage is for those who wish to work and build upon their Love by exercising trust in each other and in jesus Christ. Our goal should be to eventually be married in the temple and to be sealed eternally to our companion. As we continue in marriage, to raise children in righteous paths. This is what can bring us one of the sweetest joys in life.It is often said that we are to be our eternal Partners better. We are to seek what's best for them and there to seek what's best for us</p>
