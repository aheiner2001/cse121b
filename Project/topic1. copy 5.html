      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>Testimony is something personal. Although it is common to seek strength in other people's testimonies, it is important that we develop our own beliefs about who God is and who His Son is. Elder Stevenson shares questions about what we should ask about our testimony. One of the questions that he asked is, how should we share our testimony? Our testimony is for us but also should be shared with others. As we share our testimony, more light and knowledge will come into our minds, and our testimony will grow. Although we may feel that a testimony can only be built by ourselves, we should ask the Lord to help us build our testimonies. He is the one who can give us spiritually defining insight that will lead us to be strong.</p>
