      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>In this last General Conference, just one week ago, I heard many teachings about the importance of covenants and the power that they bring. What does it mean to have a fullness of joy? A fullness of joy is when we are received again into the presence of our Heavenly Father. To be able to achieve this goal, we are to follow the path of covenants, or the Covenant path. As we participate in these covenants, we are open to a closer relationship with our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. As we keep our covenants, we are able to see the power of Jesus Christ more completely in our lives.</p>
